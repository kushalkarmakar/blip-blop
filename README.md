```
git clone https://github.com/kushalkarmakar/blip-blop.git

After cloning, run an
```
npm install

to snag all of the dependencies. 

Of course, you need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. I also strongly recommend [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) as it makes testing *much* easier.
